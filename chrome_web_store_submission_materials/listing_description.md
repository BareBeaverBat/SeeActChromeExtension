TODO general explanation

TODO make the pitch about user-friendly UI/UX
    very informative UI, with additional information available via hover-over
    keyboard shortcuts
    providing the option of monitor mode for safer exploration of dangerous use cases and for easier exploration of model behavior/capabilities with hints/prodding

TODO make the pitch about customizability
    choosing between several major AI model providers
    choosing their own balance between minimizing cost in failed tasks vs minimizing the frequency of premature termination of tasks that would've succeeded
    customizing the UI's behavior (e.g. whether to keep around the history entries from previous tasks, whether to show the monitor mode UI elements)
